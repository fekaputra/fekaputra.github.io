  abstract = {Small and medium-sized organisations face challenges in acquiring, storing and analysing personal data, particularly sensitive data (e.g., data of medical nature), due to data protection regulations, such as the GDPR in the EU, which stipulates high standards in data protection. Consequently, these organisations often refrain from collecting data centrally, which means losing the potential of data analytics and learning from aggregated user data. To enable organisations to leverage the full-potential of the collected personal data, two main technical challenges need to be addressed: (i) organisations must preserve the privacy of individual users and honour their consent, while (ii) being able to provide data and algorithmic governance, e.g., in the form of audit trails, to increase trust in the result and support reproducibility of the data analysis tasks performed on the collected data. Such an auditable, privacy-preserving data analysis is currently challenging to achieve, as existing methods and tools only offer partial solutions to this problem, e.g., data representation of audit trails and user consent, automatic checking of usage policies or data anonymisation. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no approach providing an integrated architecture for auditable, privacy-preserving data analysis. To address these gaps, as the main contribution of this paper, we propose the WellFort approach, a semantic-enabled architecture for auditable, privacy-preserving data analysis which provides secure storage for users' sensitive data with explicit consent, and delivers a trusted, auditable analysis environment for executing data analytic processes in a privacy-preserving manner. Additional contributions include the adaptation of Semantic Web technologies as an integral part of the WellFort architecture, and the demonstration of the approach through a feasibility study with a prototype supporting use cases from the medical domain. Our evaluation shows that WellFort enables privacy preserving analysis of data, and collects sufficient information in an automated way to support its auditability at the same time.},

Due to its rapid growth and impact on several communities in the last two decades, there is a need to better understand the space of these SWeML Systems, their characteristics, and trends. Yet, surveys that adopt principled and unbiased approaches are missing. To fill this gap, we performed a systematic study and analyzed nearly 500 papers published in the last decade in this area, where we focused on evaluating architectural, and application-specific features. Our analysis identified a rapidly growing interest in SWeML Systems, with a high impact on several application domains and tasks. Catalysts for this rapid growth are the increased application of deep learning and knowledge graph technologies. By leveraging the in-depth understanding of this area acquired through this study, a further key contribution of this paper is a classification system for SWeML Systems which we publish as ontology.},

The review process can be time consuming, since reviewers read text documents submitted by researchers and provide their feedback. Moreover, it requires specific expert knowledge in data stewardship, which is scarce. Machine-actionable Data Management Plans (maDMPs) and semantic technologies increase the potential for automatic assessment of information contained in DMPs. However, the level of automation and new possibilities are still not well-explored and leveraged. This paper discusses methods for the automation of DMP assessment. It goes beyond generating human-readable reports. It explores how the information contained in maDMPs can be used to provide automated pre-assessment or to fetch further information, allowing reviewers to better judge the content. We map the identified methods to various reviewer goals.},

Deriving causality knowledge as a basis for explanations has been addressed with rule-based, symbolic AI systems. However, these systems are limited in their scope to discovering causalities that can be inferred by their rule base. To address this gap, we propose a neural-symbolic architecture that augments symbolic approaches with sub-symbolic components, in order to broaden the scope of the identified causalities. Concretely, we use Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) to solve causality knowledge derivation as a link prediction problem. Experimental results show that the neural-symbolic approach can predict causality knowledge with a good performance and has the potential to predict causalities that were not present in the symbolic system, thus broadening the causality knowledge scope of symbolic approaches.},

The technology-agnostic approach of the current maDMP specification: (i) does not explicitly link to related data models or ontologies, (ii) has no standardised way to describe controlled vocabularies, and (iii) is extensible but has no clear mechanism to distinguish between the core specification and its extensions.This paper reports on a community effort to create the DMP Common Standard Ontology (DCSO) as a serialisation of the DCS core concepts, with a particular focus on a detailed description of the components of the ontology. Our initial result shows that the proposed DCSO can become a suitable candidate for a reference serialisation of the DMP Common Standard.},

One of the information sources for building knowledge graphs is text data available in many digital system, such as E-commerce platform. In this paper, we proposed an approach to extract knowledge graph entities from product text available from E-commerce platforms. We utilize transfer learning technique with full-fine tuning from an existing trained model in order to recognize the entities due to the limitation of labeled data. Since some English terms are expressed in product texts, we used multilingual pretrained models with the Transformer Architecture, i.e. multilingual-BERT-base-cased (mBERT) and XLM-RoBERTa-base (XLMR) in our approach. The extracted entities were then mapped into a knowledge graph by adopting Text to Knowledge Graph (T2KG) framework components, i.e. using entity mapping and triple integration. The training data contains 1.500 labeled texts, while the test data contains 216 labeled texts conducted in three versions of data and four scenarios. Our evaluation result showed that the XLMR model performed better than mBERT for entity extraction task with an average F1-score of 0,895. Furthermore, we manually evaluate the knowledge graph mapping and construction using 1.445 product texts from two E-commerce platforms, which resulted in 338 entities formed in the knowledge graph with mapping precision 0,94.},

The use of data visualization tools, e.g., Wikidata Query Service and YASGUI, can help address this challenge. However, existing tools are either focused just on a specific KG or only provided as a web interface. This paper proposes VizKG, a framework that provides a wide range of visualizations for SPARQL query results over KGs. VizKG aims to assist users in extracting patterns and insights from data in KGs, and hence supporting further KG analysis. VizKG features a wrapper that links SPARQL query results and external visualization libraries by mapping query result variables to the required visualization components, currently allowing for 24 types of visualizations. Not only that, VizKG also includes visualization recommendations for arbitrary SPARQL query results as well as extension mechanisms for additional visualization types. In our evaluation, the visualization recommendation feature of VizKG achieves an accuracy of 87.8\%. To demonstrate the usefulness of VizKG in practical settings, this paper also reports on use case evaluation over various domains and KGs. A Python-based, Jupyter Notebook friendly implementation of VizKG is openly available at https://pypi.org/project/VizKG/.},

Building an explainable cyber-physical system requires deriving explanations from system events and causality between the system elements. Cyber-physical energy systems such as smart grids involve cyber and physical aspects of energy systems and other elements, namely social and economic. Moreover, a smart-grid scale can range from a small village to a large region across countries. Therefore, integrating these varieties of data and knowledge is a fundamental challenge to build an explainable cyber-physical energy system. This paper aims to use knowledge graph based framework to solve this challenge. The framework consists of an ontology to model and link data from various sources and graph-based algorithm to derive explanations from the events. A simulated demand response scenario covering the above aspects further demonstrates the applicability of this framework.},

  abstract = {Both symbolic and subsymbolic AI research have seen a recent surge driven by innovative approaches, such as neural networks and knowledge graphs. Further opportunities lie in the combined use of these two paradigms in ways that benefit from their complementary strengths. Accordingly, there is much research at the confluence of these two research areas and a number of efforts were already made to survey and analyze the resulting research area. However, to our knowledge, none of these surveys rely on methodologies that aim to capture an evidence-based characterization of the area while at the same time being reproducible. To fill in this gap, in this paper we report on our ongoing work to apply a systematic mapping study methodology to better characterise systems in this area. Given the breadth of the area, we scope the study to focus on systems that combine semantic web technologies and machine learning, which we call SWeML Systems. While the study is still ongoing, we hereby report on its design and the first results obtained.},

  abstract = {Log files are a vital source of information for keeping systems running and healthy. However, analyzing raw log data, i.e., textual records of system events, typically involves tedious searching for and inspecting clues, as well as tracing and correlating them across log sources. Existing log management solutions ease this process with efficient data collection, storage, and normalization mechanisms, but identifying and linking entities across log sources and enriching them with background knowledge is largely an unresolved challenge. To facilitate a knowledge-based approach to log analysis, this paper introduces SLOGERT, a flexible framework and workflow for automated construction of knowledge graphs from arbitrary raw log messages. At its core, it automatically identifies rich RDF graph modelling patterns to represent types of events and extracted parameters that appear in a log stream. We present the workflow, the developed vocabularies for log integration, and our prototypical implementation. To demonstrate the viability of this approach, we conduct a performance analysis and illustrate its application on a large public log dataset in the security domain.},

  abstract = {In many countries worldwide, including Austria, the environmental impact of production facilities is strongly regulated leading to authorities issuing a large number of legal permits on this topic. The access of interested parties to these permits is typically supported by search systems that present a structured view of the permits along their key elements, such as issuing authority or their legal basis. In this paper, we present a real-life use case from Austria's Environment Agency, where the extraction of such key elements represents a non-trivial task for laypersons with limited legal knowledge: the heterogeneity of data, complex language, and implicit information hinder the manual data extraction process and can lead to poor quality in data management. Based on an analysis of the use case's main requirements, we propose an architecture for a system to support the extraction of key elements from legal permits by laypersons. The system combines methods and techniques based on Knowledge Graphs / Semantic Web and Machine Learning technologies and aims to be auditable in terms of its operation.},

  abstract = {Smart city infrastructures such as transportation and energy networks are evolving into so-called cyber physical social systems (CPSSs), which collect and leverage citizens' data in order to adapt services to citizens' needs. The privacy implications of such systems are, however, significant and need to be addressed. Current systems either try to escape the privacy challenge via anonymization or use very rigid, hard-coded workflows that have been agreed with a data protection authority. In the case of the latter, there is a severe impact on data quality and richness, whereas in the former, only these hard-coded flows are permitted resulting in diminished functionality and potential. We address these limitations via user modeling in terms of investigating how to model and semantically represent user consent, preferences, and data usage policies that will guide the processing of said data in the data lake. Data protection is a horizontal field and consequently very wide. Therefore, we focus on a concrete setting where we extend the domain-agnostic SPECIAL policy language for a smart mobility use case supplied by Vienna's largest utility provider. To that end, (1) we create an extension of SPECIAL in terms of a core CPSS vocabulary that lowers the semantic gap between the domain agnostic terms of SPECIAL and the vocabulary of the use case; (2) we propose a workflow that supports defining domain-specific vocabularies for complex CPSSs; and (3) show that these two contributions allow successfully achieving the goals of our setting.},

Cyber-physical Social System (CPSS) are complex systems that span the boundaries of the cyber, physical and social spheres. They play an important role in a variety of domains ranging from industry to smart city applications. As such, these systems necessarily need to take into account, combine and make sense of heterogeneous data sources from legacy systems, from the physical layer and also the social groups that are part of/use the system. The collection, cleansing and integration of these data sources represents a major effort not only during the operation of the system, but also during its engineering and design. Indeed, while ongoing efforts are concerned primarily with the operation of such systems, limited focus has been put on supporting the engineering phase of CPSS. To address this shortcoming, within the CitySPIN project we aim to create a platform that supports stakeholders involved in the design of these systems especially in terms of support for data management. To that end, we develop methods and techniques based on Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies for the acquisition and integration of heterogeneous data from disparate structured, semi-structured and unstructured sources, including open data and social data. In this paper we present the overall system architecturewith a core focus on data acquisition and integration.We demon-strate our approach through a prototypical implementation of an adaptive planning use case for public transportation scheduling.},

However, due to the lack of standards,tools, and best practices, many organizations struggle to adapt theirinfrastructure and processes to ensure and demonstrate that alldata processing is in compliance with users' given consent. TheSPECIAL EU H2020 project has developed vocabularies that canformally describe data subjects' given consent as well as meth-ods that use this description to automatically determine whetherprocessing of the data according to a given policy is compliantwith the given consent.

  abstract = {Business process compliance checking enables organisations to assess whether their processes fulfil a given set of constraints, such as regulations, laws, or guidelines. Whilst many process analysts still rely on ad-hoc, often handcrafted per-case checks, a variety of constraint languages and approaches have been developed in recent years to provide automated compliance checking. A salient example is DECLARE , a well-established declarative process specification language based on temporal logics. DECLARE specifies the behaviour of processes through temporal rules that constrain the execution of tasks. So far, however, automated compliance checking approaches typically report compliance only at the aggregate level, using binary evaluations of constraints on execution traces. Consequently, their results lack gran-ular information on violations and their context, which hampers auditability of process data for analytic and forensic purposes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages semantic technologies for compliance checking. Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we translate DECLARE templates into statements in SHACL, a graph-based constraint language. Then, we evaluate the resulting constraints on the graph-based, semantic representation of process execution logs. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by testing its implementation on real-world event logs. Finally, we discuss its implications and future research directions.},

  abstract = {The recent developments in the engineering domain, often associated with the German term “Industrie 4.0”, require more flexible production systems. Such modern production systems are typically designed in Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Environments (MDEEs), where stakeholders from diverse engineering disciplines need to integrate data from heterogeneous data sources and manage changes within the integrated data sources, so that changes in one dataset are reflected in other relevant data sources. MDEEs, therefore, strongly rely on data integration across various stakeholders and engineering disciplines. Semantic Web Technologies support data integration using Ontology-Based Data Integration (OBDI) approaches, which, on their term are a prerequisite to support knowledge change management in MDEEs. Three variants of OBDI approaches have been proposed: single-ontology, multipleontology, and hybrid approaches. However, this classification is deemed too generic for understanding which approaches are most suitable in MDEEs. A first challenge, on the one hand, consists in understanding the suitability of OBDI approach variants for diverse MDEE scenarios and considering potential extensions thereof. On the other hand, since the topic of knowledge change management has been primarily investigated for single-ontology OBDI approaches, a second challenge therefore consists in providing knowledge change management techniques that are also applicable for more complex OBDI approaches (e.g., hybrid approaches). To address the first challenge, in this thesis, we evaluate the feasibility and suitability of OBDI approaches for diverse MDEE use cases. We propose a new OBDI variant called Global-as-View OBDI and distill criteria for classifying OBDI variants that allow for their informed selection for use in diverse MDEE scenarios. Our second line of work addresses the gap in supporting knowledge change management in complex OBDI variants. To that end, we define a set of knowledge change management requirements for complex OBDI in MDEE based on use cases from the engineering domain. Based on these requirements, we develop a generic, technology-agnostic framework of knowledge change management for hybrid and Global-as-View OBDI scenarios. To evaluate our approach, we instantiate the reference framework as a research prototype and conduct an initial feasibility study. The main outputs of the thesis are: (1) a systematic literature review on OBDI applications in MDEE, based on which we propose a new OBDI variant and guidelines for the selection of OBDI variants based on application context characteristics; (2) the evaluation of the OBDI selection guidelines to design concrete prototypes of OBDI applications for tackling two use cases in MDEEs; and (3) the definition of a generic knowledge change management framework for MDEEs and its feasibility evaluation.},

  abstract = {When reusing software architectural knowledge, such as design patterns or design decisions, software architects need support for exploring architectural knowledge collections, e.g., for finding related items. While semantic-based architectural knowledge management tools are limited to supporting lookup-based tasks through faceted search and fall short of enabling exploration, semantic-based exploratory search systems primarily focus on web-scale knowledge graphs without having been adapted to enterprise-scale knowledge graphs (EKG). We investigate how and to what extent exploratory search can be supported on EKGs of architectural knowledge. We propose an approach for building exploratory search systems on EKGs and demonstrate its use within Siemens, which resulted in the STAR system used in practice by 200–300 software architects. We found that the EKG's ontology allows making previously implicit organisational knowledge explicit and this knowledge informs the design of suitable relatedness metrics to support exploration. Yet, the performance of these metrics heavily depends on the characteristics of the EKG's data. Therefore both statistical and user-based evaluations can be used to select the right metric before system implementation.},

However, considerable amount of data in open data portals remain inaccessible as linked data. This is due to the nature of data portals having large number of small-size dataset which makes writing mapping description becomes tedious and error-prone. Moreover, these data sources requires additional preprocessing before To solve this challenge, We introduce extensions to RML to support required tasks and developed RMLx, a visual web-interface to create RML mappings. Using this interface, the process of creating mapping description can become faster and less error-prone. Furthermore, the process of linked data generation can be wrapped as to enable integration with other data in a linked data exploration environment. We explore on four different use cases to identify the requirements followed by describing how these are solved.},

  abstract = {Today's industrial production plants are complex mechatronic systems. In the course of the production plant lifecycle, engineers from a variety of disciplines (e.g., mechanics, electronics, automation) need to collaborate in multi-disciplinary settings that are characterized by heterogeneity in terminology, methods, and tools. This collaboration yields a variety of engineering artifacts that need to be linked and integrated, which on the technical level is reflected in the need to integrate heterogeneous data. Semantic Web technologies, in particular ontology-based data integration (OBDI), are promising to tackle this challenge that has attracted strong interest from the engineering research community. This interest has resulted in a growing body of literature that is dispersed across the Semantic Web and Automation System Engineering research communities and has not been systematically reviewed so far. We address this gap with a survey reflecting on OBDI applications in the context of Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Environment (MDEE). To this end, we analyze and compare 23 OBDI applications from both the Semantic Web and the Automation System Engineering research communities. Based on this analysis, we (i) categorize OBDI variants used in MDEE, (ii) identify key problem context characteristics, (iii) compare strengths and limitations of OBDI variants as a function of problem context, and (iv) provide recommendation guidelines for the selection of OBDI variants and technologies for OBDI in MDEE.},

Shifting testing and tuning of industrial plants and their automation systems from the real world to simulated environments is a part of a virtualization, which is one of the key movements in emerging areas of Industry 4.0 and factories of the future. Although simulations bring a large variety of benefits, they suffer from a time-consuming and error-prone design phase, which limits their use in industrial practice. This paper proposes a new design method called AML2SIM, which transforms the real plant description represented in AutomationML (AML) and generates a dynamic simulation model (SIM). The proposed method signifcantly improves the engineering and re-design of simulation models in terms of saving time and effort of experts as the models can be easily re-generated based on a given AutomationML plant model. Simulations are assembled from simulation blocks that are shared among various projects in simulation libraries, hence the method contributes to reuse of simulation artifacts.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. [Context] In Multi-Disciplinary Engineering (MDE) environments, the engineering of industrial production systems requires the collaboration of engineers coming from different disciplines. Engineers typically apply discipline specific tools and data models with limited collaboration capabilities. These loosely coupled tools and heterogeneous data models hinder efficient change management and defect detection, which makes MDE projects unnecessarily risky and error prone. [Objective] This paper presents an adapted review approach, AML-Review, for multi-disciplinary engineering (MDE) projects based on best practices for reviews in software engineering. [Method] Software reviews have been successfully used for early defect detection in Software Engineering. However, adaptations are needed for defect detection in MDE environments. We focus on production systems models according to the emerging AutomationML standard. [Results] We evaluated the feasibility of the AML-Review process with requirements and an AutomationML model from a real-world application scenario. The AML-Review process provides the benefits of systematic and traceable review results for MDE projects based on AutomationML. [Conclusion] The prototype results imply that systematic and structured review processes help to improve traceability of requirements and defects and increase defect detection performance.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM. The process of designing Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS), e.g., modern power plants or steel mills, typically takes place in a multi-disciplinary engineering environment, in which experts from various engineering domains and organizations work together towards creating complex engineering artifacts. The process of designing such complex engineering artifacts requires iterations and redesign phases, which lead to continuous changes of the data and knowledge. To manage changes in such environment, we have previously proposed a generic reference process for conducting Knowledge Change Management and Analysis (KCMA). This paper implements this process for the case study of a modern Hydro Power Plant by adapting the proposed generic reference process into a scientific prototype developed using Semantic Web Technologies. Finally, we conduct an evaluation to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed reference process and the developed prototype. Thus, the contribution of this paper is twofolds: (1) A tool-supported prototype for KCMA of a hydro power plant, and (2) A feasibility evaluation of this prototype that reports feedback and lessons learned for achieving KCMA in real-world case studies.},

Recently, Semantic Web Technologies (SWT) have been introduced and adopted to address the problem of enterprise data integration (e.g., to solve the problem of terms and concepts heterogeneity within large organizations). One of the challenges of adopting SWT for enterprise data integration is to provide the means to define and validate structural constraints over Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs. This is difficult since RDF graph axioms behave like implications instead of structural constraints. SWT researchers and practitioners have proposed several solutions to address this challenge (e.g., SPIN and Shape Expression). However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them provide an integrated solution within open source ontology editors (e.g., Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}}). We identified this absence of the integrated solution and developed SHACL4P, a Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} plugin for defining and validating Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL), the upcoming W3C standard for constraint validation within Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} ontology editor.},

The engineering phase of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) is a multi-disciplinary process in which representatives of diverse engineering disciplines collaborate to deliver a complex CPPS. To ensure optimal project management as well as to avoid risks of inconsistencies between engineering models created by engineers from different disciplines, support is needed for integrating and subsequently analyzing diverse engineering data. AutomationML is an emerging data exchange format for engineering data which makes the first step towards the easier exchange of engineering data. Yet, there is a lack of tool support for integrating, making sense of and analyzing AML files. In this paper, we explore the use of Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies to provide extended functionality on top of AML that allows advanced data analytics on engineering data such as intuitive browsing of interlinked engineering models and queries for project-wide verification and validation activities. As a result of these investigations, we present the AutomationML Analyzer prototypical implementation to showcase some of the functionalities made possible by Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies in this context.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Typical large-scale systems engineering projects depend on seamless cooperation and data exchange of experts from various engineering domains and organizations that work in a heterogeneous engineering environment. Available software tools support individual engineering disciplines quite well, but they only represent a discipline-specific view on the engineering plant. Consequently, a so-called integrated plant model captures and combines all different views into one representation in order to provide an overarching, discipline-independent view on the engineering plant. However, in order to support effective engineering processes, like change management, stakeholders need to be able to (a) define the scope of their changes they want to merge into the integrated plant model rather than the latest status of their view with various fragile adaptations, and (b) extract only engineering information from integrated plant model which is in the scope of the stakeholders's discipline and interest. In this paper, we describe requirements identified in industrial use cases regarding filtering capabilities on (integrated) engineering plant models and model-driven engineering techniques for model-slicing applied on AutomationML models. The approach contributes to quality assurance and fault-prevention in engineering data since it helps to focus on parts of the engineering plant model relevant in certain engineering processes.},

  abstract = {This chapter is focused on the technical aspects of semantic data inte-gration that provides solutions for bridging semantic gaps between common project-level concepts and the local tool concepts as identified in the Engineering Knowledge Base (EKB). Based on the elicitation of use case requirements from automation systems engineering, the chapter identifies required capabilities an EKB software architecture has to consider. The chapter describes four EKB software architecture variants and their components, and discusses identified drawbacks and advantages regarding the utilization of ontologies. A benchmark is defined to evaluate the efficiency of the EKB software architecture variants in the context of selected quality attributes, like performance and scalability. Main results suggest that architectures relying on a relational database still outperform traditional ontology storages while NoSQL databases outperforms for query execution. In large-scale systems engineering projects, like power plants, steel mills, or car manufactures, the seamless cooperation and data exchange of expert knowledge from various engineering domains and organizations is a crucial success factor (Biffl et al. 2009a). This environment consists of a wide range of engineering systems and tools that differ in the underlying technical platforms and the used data models. Each domain or organization usually prefers using their own well-known models, from now on referred as local tool models. In order to successfully develop projects, it is essential to integrate important knowledge of different domain experts. However, these experts usually prefer using their well-known local tool models. In addition, they want to access data from other tools within their local data repre-sentation approach (Moser and Biffl 2012). The standardization of data interchange is one of the most promising approaches (Wiesner et al. 2011) to enable efficient data integration that allows experts to continue using their familiar data models and formats. This approach is based on agreeing on a minimal common model for data exchange that represents the common concepts shared among different disciplines on project level. Chapter 2 presented main use cases with typical process steps during the engineering phase within the life cycle of production systems. Selected scenarios focused on the capability to interact appropriately within a multidisciplinary engineering network while pointing out the need for a common vocabulary over all engineering disciplines involved in an engineering organization. The described challenges in the context of engineering data integration referred to a consistent production system plant model in order to support quality-assured parallel engi-neering, and the ability to access and analyze integrated data, e.g., for project progress and project quality reports. Versioning of exchanged information helps to improve change management and team collaboration over the course of the engi-neering project. As part of an efficient data management it is essential for process observations, project monitoring, and control across engineering disciplines (Moser et al. 2011b). As a common baseline it can be concluded that it is necessary to clearly dis-tinguish between local concepts of engineering tools and common concepts (Moser and Biffl 2010) (i.e., data sets representing heterogeneous but semantically corre-sponding local data elements) at project level. Consequently, interoperability between heterogeneous engineering environments is only supported if the semantic gap between local tool concepts and common project-level concepts can be prop-erly bridged. The Engineering Knowledge Base (EKB) (Moser and Biffl 2010) (see Chap. 4) provides the means for semantic integration of the heterogeneous models of each discipline using ontologies, and thus facilitates seamless communication, interaction, and data exchange. Semantic technologies are capable of linking cor-responding local concepts of engineering tools with each other via common project-level concepts representing the data integration needs of engineering dis-ciplines at their interfaces. 182 R.

Multi-Disciplinary Engineering (MDEng) environments involve a wide range of models, processes and tools that were not designed to cooperate together. The Ontology-Based Information Integra-tion (OBII) approach has been proposed to address the integration issue within such environments. However, knowledge changes management and analysis (KCMA) process within the environ-ment are not covered within the OBII approach. While the tradi-tional ontology change management approach has been investi-gated to the general problem, it remains unclear how to use the available solutions within MDEng context. In this paper, we ex-tend the OBII approach to enable the KCMA process. We have identified the main KCMA requirements within MDEng projects and studied the related work of Ontology Change Management to propose a suitable solution, as well as suggesting further works.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015. Ontology change is an important part of the Semantic Web field that helps researchers and practitioners to deal with changes performed in ontologies. Ontology change is especially important in Ontology-Based Information Integration (OBII) systems, where several ontologies are interrelated and therefore, changes raise various complexities and implications, such as modifications of ontology mappings and change propagation. Current approaches to ontology change mainly focus on a single ontology and therefore do not properly address the constraints specific to OBII systems. To address the challenge of ontology change in OBII contexts, we plan to adapt successful techniques proposed both by Semantic Web and Model-Driven Engineering communities. We discuss the research goals, methods, and evaluation options to address this challenge. Real-world case studies are used for the development and evaluation of the proposed methods.},

Detecting defects across discipline boundaries early and efficiently in the engineering process is a challenging task due to heterogeneous data sources. In this paper we explore how Semantic Web technologies can address this challenge and present the Ontology-based Cross-Disciplinary Defect Detection (OCDD) approach that supports automated cross-disciplinary defect detection in ME environments, while allowing engineers to keep their well-known tools, data models, and their customary engineering workflows. We evaluate the approach in a case study at an industry partner, a large-scale industrial automation software provider, and report on our experiences and lessons learned. Major result was that the OCDD approach was found useful in the evaluation context and more efficient than manual defect detection, if cross-disciplinary defects had to be handled.},

Unfortunately, valuable knowledge collected in the SLR process is publicly available only to a limited extent, which considerably slows down building BoKs incrementally. [Objective] In this paper, we introduce the Systematic Knowledge Engineering (SKE) process to support building up BoKs from empirical studies efficiently. [Method] SKE is based on the SLR process and on Knowledge Engineering (KE) practices to provide a Knowledge Base (KB) with semantic technologies that enable reusing intermediate data extraction results and querying of empirical evidence. We evaluated SKE by building a software inspection EMSE BoK KB from knowledge acquired by controlled experiments. We elicited relevant queries from EMSE researchers and systematically integrated information from 30 representative research papers into the KB. [Results] The resulting KB was effective in answering the queries, enabling knowledge reuse for analyses beyond the results from the SLR process. [Conclusion] SKE showed promising results in the software inspection context and should be evaluated in other contexts for building EMSE BoKs faster.},

Recently, the Systematic Knowledge Engineering (SKE) process has been introduced to help researchers build up an empirical software engineering (EMSE) Body of Knowledge (BoK) based on a systematic literature review process. However, the SKE process does not explain how to effectively capture and represent the EMSE knowledge to enable efficient data analysis. In this paper, we introduce the EMSE Research Knowledge Base Building (RKB) process, which guides knowledge engineers in developing and using a knowledge base (KB) for the SKE process based on contributions from heterogeneous data sources. We evaluate the RKB process in the context of three research topics from the EMSE domain: software inspection experiments, theory construct identification, and threats to validity. Major results are that the RKB process is effective in guiding the knowledge engineer to build a KB that allows answering the EMSE-specific queries. The RKB process shows promising results in the EMSE research context and should be investigated in other research contexts as well.},

We conducted an initial proof of concept on the feasibility of using the TTV KB and analyzed its content.
